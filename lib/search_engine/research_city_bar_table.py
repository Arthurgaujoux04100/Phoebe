    scorer: This parameter allows you to specify a custom scoring function to determine how similar two strings are.
    fuzz.token_set_ratio: This is a specific scoring function provided by the fuzzywuzzy (or rapidfuzz) library.
    It calculates the similarity between two strings by considering the set of tokens (words) in each string.
    It is particularly useful when the order of words doesn't matter, as it ignores duplicate words and focuses on the unique set of words in each string.

    This parameter specifies the maximum number of top matches to return. In this case, it will return up to 5 of the most similar city names from the correct_city_names list.
